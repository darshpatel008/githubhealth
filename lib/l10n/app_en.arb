  "liver": "Clear or light yellow urine is normal. If it turns dark yellow and stays that way, this could indicate a liver problem, specifically the buildup of bilirubin due to improper liver function. This dark urine is seen in about 25% of liver cirrhosis patients.\n    - Stool: A healthy stool is typically yellow because of bile. If the liver is compromised and unable to produce enough bile, the stool may turn pale. If ignored, the stool can become black and tarry, which indicates internal bleeding and signals an advanced stage of liver disease.\n- Liver Pain:\n    - Pain in the upper right abdomen, just below the rib cage, can be a sign of liver damage. This pain is usually caused by inflammation of surrounding tissues, as the liver itself does not contain pain-sensing nerves. Over 80% of people with liver cirrhosis experience this pain, which is often described as a pulsating sensation. It can also extend to the neck and right shoulder. If this pain is persistent, it should be taken seriously, as it could be linked to fatty liver, hepatitis, or even excessive alcohol consumption.\n- Discoloration:\n    - Yellowing of the skin, nails, or eyes (known as jaundice) is a major sign of liver dysfunction. This yellowish tint occurs when the liver cannot eliminate excess bilirubin. Over 66% of liver cirrhosis patients experience yellowing palms, while black pigmentation around the neck, in the form of spots, warts, or moles, can also signal liver malfunction. If any unusual discoloration is noticed, it should be addressed as it indicates a liver issue.\n- Fluid Retention:\n    - Swelling in the abdomen (ascites) or legs can be due to liver damage. The liver produces a protein called albumin, which helps regulate body fluid. When liver function is compromised, albumin levels drop, causing water retention. This often results in a distended belly or swollen legs. In more advanced stages, this can lead to pitted edema, where pressing the swollen area leaves a dent. This symptom, seen in severe liver cirrhosis, is also associated with kidney issues and should be promptly addressed by a doctor.\n\n Preventive Measures for liver damage:\n\n- Stay Hydrated:\n    - Drink plenty of water to support the liver’s detoxification process. Aim for at least 8-10 glasses of water per day to keep the body hydrated and flush out toxins effectively.\n- Maintain a Healthy Diet:\n    - Limit junk food: Avoid deep-fried, excessively salty, and refined sugary foods, as they put extra stress on the liver.\n    - Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Foods like leafy greens, garlic, nuts, and fatty fish support liver health.\n    - Consume liver-friendly foods: Incorporate foods like beets, turmeric, and sugarcane juice, which help reduce liver heat and support liver function.\n- Limit Alcohol Intake:\n    - Alcohol can cause serious liver damage over time. Reduce alcohol consumption to prevent conditions like fatty liver, hepatitis, and cirrhosis. If you drink, do so in moderation.\n-Avoid Unnecessary Medications:\n    - Avoid overuse of antibiotics, painkillers, and other medications unless prescribed by a doctor. These can stress the liver, as it works to break down chemicals in the body.\n- Exercise Regularly:\n    - Engage in regular physical activity, such as walking, jogging, or yoga, to maintain a healthy weight and prevent liver fat buildup. Exercise improves overall liver function by reducing fat and inflammation.\n- Manage Weight:\n    - Maintain a healthy body weight, as obesity and excessive belly fat are linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A balanced diet and exercise can prevent fat from accumulating in the liver.\n- Get Regular Check-ups:\n    - Schedule routine liver function tests, especially if you have risk factors such as alcohol consumption, obesity, or a family history of liver disease. Early detection helps in managing liver conditions.\n- Limit Toxin Exposure:\n    - Reduce exposure to environmental toxins, such as chemicals and pesticides, which the liver works hard to filter. Use natural cleaning products and avoid inhaling harmful fumes when possible.\n- Moderate Sugar and Salt:\n    - High sugar and salt intake can harm the liver. Limit processed foods that are high in sugar and sodium. Opt for natural sweeteners and reduce salt in your diet.\n- Consider Liver-Supportive Supplements:\n    - Consult your doctor before taking liver supplements like milk thistle or bhringrajasava, an Ayurvedic tonic known to support liver health.\n\n- Foot Signs:\nLiver problems can manifest through signs in the feet. Some indicators include:\n    - Red/brown dots on the lower legs: These may suggest poor blood circulation caused by liver issues. While not always related to liver problems, they are commonly seen in such cases.\n    - Varicose veins (spider veins):These red and blue veins may be a sign of liver fibrosis, which is the third stage of liver damage after fatty liver. Fibrosis is still reversible but can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer if untreated.\n    - Cracked heels: This can occur due to inadequate bile production, which hampers fat digestion, causing dryness that leads to cracked heels.\n    - Itching, hot feet, pain, and foul-smelling feet: These are additional foot-related signs of liver congestion, excess toxins, and failed detoxification. For example, foul-smelling feet can result from toxins not being processed by the liver and being released through the skin instead.",
  "lungCancer": "The main causes of lung cancer include:\n\n1. Smoking – The most significant risk factor, responsible for the majority of lung cancer cases. Both active smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke increase the risk.\n2.
